Projectâ€™s Objective and Goals

The objective of this project is to develop a simulator based on a real 1-D hydraulic slider.
After preparing a suitable simulator based on the mathematical model of the actuator, then
the students should check the simulator output for different type of inputs.
At the end, the students should provide a linear PID controller for the systems and they
should tune the controller for different inputs to find the best control values. Based on above
research work students should prepare a report by mentioning all the steps of the work and
adding their discussion and conclusion to the work.


* Create constants .m file

* Design system model in simulink

	* Create simulink file.

* Test the system model with: Step, Sine, Pulse and Ramp inputs

* Add a PID controller to the Simulink model and close the loop by feeding back the
position

* Tune the PID controller for every input in a way that the model output is the best
possible

* Record all your results, graphs and models

* Write your report

	* Create report file from template
